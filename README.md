AirBnB clone project
=========================
This is the first step towards building the first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because it will used in building the following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
